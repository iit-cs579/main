    "3. **Justice:** ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly — the fair distribution of costs and benefits to potential research participants — and equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the above principals leads to the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Informed Consent:**  Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. **Assessment of Risks and Benefits:** We must protect against risk of harm to subjects and also consider loss of the substantial benefits that might be gained from research.\n",

    "<br><br>  \n",
    "3. **Selection of Subjects:** Potentially beneficial research should not be restricted only to some subjects; nor should only \"undesirable\" persons be selected for risky research.\n",

While the AOL username has been changed to a random ID number, the abilitiy to analyze all searches by a single user will often lead people to easily determine who the user is, and what they are up to.
